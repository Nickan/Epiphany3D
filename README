A 3D game using the awesome power of LibGDX libgdx.badlogicgames.com. 

I am making this game for educational purposes, if I violated someone or
a company about my game, please notify me and I will change it immediately.

The runnable jar for desktop is in Epiphany3D-desktop/bin and the apk for
android device is in Epiphany3D-android/bin.

Tested running on Windows 7 and Ubuntu 13.10 but requires Java JRE/JDK
installed for the desktop version.
